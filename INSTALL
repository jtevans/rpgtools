Requirements:
  Apache 2.2.x or newer
  PHP 8.3.X or newer

The install process is simple.

Extract the tarball (which you've probably already done if you're reading
this.)

Copy the directory created to a location inside your DocumentRoot.

If you copy the directory to DocumentRoot/tools/ then point your web
browser to http://server/tools/ to access the D&D tools.

You're done!
