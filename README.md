# rpgtools

This is the first iteration of my RPG tools. You can find them live and functional at https://jtevans.kilnar.com/rpg/dnd/tools/

This codebase will most likely remain static as I'm moving all functionality to a newer, cleaner, better inteface that uses React on the front end and similar PHP code on the back end. You can find that codebase here: https://github.com/jtevans/rpgtools2 

PS: I originally wrote MANY of these features in Pascal under DOS back in the early 1990s. This was prior to my discovery of the World Wide Web, and WELL BEFORE the creation of PHP. Alas, I've lost that Pascal code to the ages, but I still have these projects that live on.
